TODOS:

HOW TO PRIME USER TO DRAG FOR WIDTH AS WELL
- make a load screen with a resizable element that they can play around with

start the user small?


what order for the cogs? if we want rotation from the middle, have spoke come in last
- if we want rotation from outside, have the big green boi... do something?

figure out AND media query breakpoints for the perspective-creating motions

add more cogs
- performance? you may want to make the back gear six cogs and just overlap them...

loading screen depicting the spinning + hover mechanic?

DONE: add a reload button??

DONE: figure out whether or not you want cogs to fly in from the width or height adjustment

DONE: fix the damned back gear
