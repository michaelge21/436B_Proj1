HOW TO PRIME USER TO DRAG FOR WIDTH AS WELL

fix the damned back gear

what order for the cogs? if we want rotation from the middle, have spoke come in last
- if we want rotation from outside, have the big green boi... do something?

figure out AND media query breakpoints for the perspective-creating motions

add more cogs
- performance? you may want to make the back gear six cogs and just overlap them...

loading screen depicting the spinning + hover mechanic?

add a reload button??

DONE: figure out whether or not you want cogs to fly in from the width or height adjustment
